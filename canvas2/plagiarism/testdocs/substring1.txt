Since its first discovery by non-indigenous people in the mid-nineteenth century, Yosemite Valley has held a special, even religious, hold on the American conscience because its beauty makes it an incomparable valley and one of the grandest of all special temples of Nature. While Yosemite holds a special grip on the western mind, perceptions about the Valley have evolved over time due to changing politics, migration patterns and environmental concerns as man has become more attuned to his relationship and impact on nature.

Elephants are browsing animals, feeding on fruits, leaves, shoots, and tall grasses; they consume hundreds of pounds of food a day and drink up to 50 gal (190 liters) of water. They have no fixed living place, but travel about in herds of up to 100 animals, led by a young, strong male and including young bulls (males), cows (females), and calves. Old males are generally solitary or live in small groups.

We still lack robust quantitative measures of dispersal effectiveness and recruitment effects of ichthyochory. [â€¦] [S]eed dispersal in riparian and floodplain communities is carried out by a diverse suite of vertebrate dispersers. We know very little about the relative contributions of fruit-eating fish versus other frugivorous vertebrates to seed dispersal in these systems. If fish disperse the same species of seeds as birds and mammals, ecological redundancy among dispersers might mitigate losses of certain frugivores due to hunting and habitat alteration.
