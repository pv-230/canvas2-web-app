From its first discovery by the Ahwahnechee in the mid-nineteenth century Yosemite Valley has held a unique, even religious, hold on the American conscience because its beauty makes it an incomparable valley and one of the grandest of all special temples of Nature. While Yosemite holds a special grip on the western mind, perceptions about the Valley have evolved over time reflecting changing politics, human migration patterns and the rise of environmental concerns as man has become more attuned to his relationship and impact on nature.

Elephants are browsing animals, feeding on fruits, leaves, shoots, and tall grasses; they consume hundreds of pounds of food a day and drink up to 50 gal (190 liters) of water. “As a result, these large mammals place great demands on the environment and often come into conflict with people in competition for resources. ¹ They have no fixed living place, but travel about in herds of up to 100 animals, led by a young, strong mas (males), cows (females), and calves. Old males are generally solitary or live in small groups.le and including young bull

populations are exceedingly difficult to control. We still lack reliable measures of dispersal effectiveness of ichthyochory. Seed dispersal in riparian and floodplain communities is carried out by mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes, and we know very little about the relative contributions of fruit-cating fish versus other frugivorous vertebrates to seed dispersal in these systems. If fish disperse the same species of seeds as birds and mammals, it might mitigate losses of certain frugivores due to hunting and habitat alteration
